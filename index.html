        <header>Hello World</header>

              <article>
              <p>The "Hello, World!" program is a classic starting point in programming. It serves as a simple introduction to writing code and running a program. In Python, creating a "Hello, World!" program is quick and easy. Let's get started!</p>
              <code>
print("Hello, World!")
                </code>
                <p>In the code above, we have a single line that prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's how you can run this program:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                     Create a new file and save it as hello_world.py, making sure to use the .py extension, which indicates that it's a Python file.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                       Copy the code above into your hello_world.py file.
                       </li>
                      <li>Save the file.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Now, let's run the program:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Open a command-line interface or terminal.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the directory where you saved your hello_world.py file.</li>
                    <li>
                      Execute the following command:
                      </li>

      <header>Variables</header>
      <article>
        
        <p>In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They act as containers that hold values of different types, such as numbers, strings, or complex objects. Understanding variables is crucial as they play a central role in programming and enable you to work with and manipulate data effectively.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Naming_Variables">
  <header>Naming Variables</header>

      <article>
        <p>When naming variables, there are a few rules and conventions to follow:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning <code>myVariable</code> and <code>myvariable</code> are considered different variables.</li>
    <li>Variable names can consist of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_). However, they must start with a letter or an underscore.</li>
    <li>Avoid using reserved keywords, such as <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, or <code>while</code>, as variable names.</li>
    <li>Choose descriptive names that convey the purpose or meaning of the variable. For example, <code>age</code>, <code>name</code>, or <code>total_sales</code> are more meaningful than generic names like <code>x</code> or <code>var1</code>.</li>
  </ul>
        </article>
      </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Assignment">
      <header>Variable Assignment</header>
      <article>
        <p>In Python, variables are assigned values using the = operator. For example:
          </p>
         <pre><code>
message = "Hello, World!"
count = 10
pi = 3.14159
</code></pre>

        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Usage">
    <header>Variable Usage</header>

        <article>
        <p>Variables can be used throughout your program. For instance:
</p>
<pre><code>
name = "Alice"
age = 25
greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
future_age = age + 5
  </code></pre>
  <p>Variables store data and can be updated or manipulated as needed.
</p>
</article>
        </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Reassignment">
    <header>Variable Reassignment</header>
    <article>
      
      <p>In Python, you can reassign new values to variables as needed. This flexibility allows you to update the value stored in a variable dynamically. Here's an example:</p>

      <pre><code>
# Variable reassignment
x = 5
print(x)  # Output: 5

x = x + 1
print(x)  # Output: 6

x = x * 2
print(x)  # Output: 12
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, we initially assign the value 5 to the variable <code>x</code>. We then reassign <code>x</code> to <code>x + 1</code>, effectively incrementing its value by 1. Finally, we multiply <code>x</code> by 2 and update its value once again.</p>

      </article>
    </section> 
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
  <header>Variable Scope</header>
      <article>

        <p>n Python, variable scope refers to the region or context in which a variable is defined and can be accessed. The scope determines where and for how long a variable exists during the execution of a program. Understanding variable scope is important for writing clean and organized code.</p>
        <p>In Python, there are two main types of variable scope: global scope and local scope.
          </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Global Scope: Variables defined outside of any function or block have a global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere within the program, including inside functions. Global variables are typically defined at the top of the script or module and can be used throughout the entire program.
             <p>Example of a global variable:</p>
          <pre><code>
global_var = 10

def my_function():
    print(global_var) # Accessing the global variable
    my_function()  # Output: 10 </code></pre>
</li>
        <li>
          <p>Local Scope: Variables defined inside a function or block have a local scope. They are only accessible within the function or block in which they are defined. Local variables exist as long as the function or block is being executed and are destroyed once the function or block finishes execution.</p>

<p>Example of a local variable: </p>

<pre><code>
  def my_function():
    local_var = 5
    print(local_var)  # Accessing the local variable

my_function()  # Output: 5

print(local_var)  # Error: NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined
</code></pre>
          </li>
          </ol>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
      <header>Data Types</header>
        <article>
          <p>In Python, data types define the nature of the values that can be stored and manipulated within variables. Python provides several built-in data types that cater to different types of data and operations. Understanding data types is crucial as they determine the behavior and operations that can be performed on variables.</p>

          <p>Here are some commonly used data types in Python:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Numeric Types:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>int</code>: Integers, which represent whole numbers, e.g., 5, -10, 100.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>float</code>: Floating-point numbers, which represent decimal numbers with fractional parts, e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 1.0.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Text Type:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>str</code>: Strings, which represent sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). For example, "Hello, World!" or 'Python'.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              <li>
                Sequence Types:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>list</code>: Lists, which are ordered and mutable collections of items. Lists can contain elements of different data types and can be modified after creation.
<code>tuple</code>: Tuples, which are ordered and immutable collections of items. Tuples are similar to lists but cannot be modified once created.
<code>range</code>: Ranges, which represent a sequence of numbers that can be iterated over. They are often used in looping constructs.

                    </li>

                  </ul>
